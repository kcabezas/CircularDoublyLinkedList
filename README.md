# CircularDoublyLinkedList
Program to implement a circular doubly linked list.

Things to note:

-This was a homework assignment for the class CS 1332 Data Structures & Algorithms, which I took in Fall 2015.

-All the classes were provided by the teacher and teaching assistants of the class. CircularDoublyLinkedList.java came with blank public methods which needed to be filled with the appropriate code.
