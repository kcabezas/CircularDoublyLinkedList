# LinkedList
Program to implement a singly linked list and a circular doubly linked list.

Things to note:

-This was a homework assignment for the class CS 1332 Data Structures & Algorithms, which I took in Fall 2015.

-All the classes were provided by the teacher and teaching assistants of the class. SinglyLinkedList.java and CircularDoublyLinkedList.java came with blank public methods which needed to be filled with the appropriate code.
